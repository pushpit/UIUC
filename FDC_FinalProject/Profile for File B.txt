Profile for File B:

File B contains a list of complaints filed by consumers of various financial institution. Each complaints has events associated with it as well as company information for which the complaint is directed to. It also contains the information about the product type, issue type, how the complaint is submitted, what is the response time for the complaint and an optional consumer narrative specifying the actual feedback from the customer. The file is provided in XML tree format with all the different complaints are presented as child nodes of parent node "ConsumerComplaints". This XML file is equivalent of having a ConsumerComplaints table in the database and each child node "Complaint" represents a row in that table. In this sense it is actually same as File A, some of the difference I noticed are that for some of the consumers' sensitive information, File A uses 'XXXX', but File B defined a new entity "redaction" with a constant value of 'XXXX' to hide consumers' sensitive information. Also file B XML is not properly indented hence the it is smaller in size with just 9876 bytes in size compared to the file A which 10763 bytes in size. Another difference is that for timely attribute of response node the value used are 'yes/no' rather then 'Y/N'
